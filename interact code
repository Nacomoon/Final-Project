If you just copy and paste this into cloud it should work. Just put in constraints/objective function, press check mark
box and then One. Here is an example of how to put in a constraint: 2 * x + 3 * y - z <= 5
Basically same thing for objective function. Right now One will print out A,b,c, and a tableau called lptab.
Each letter represents what you think it represents with A being a matrix, b & c as list, and lptab as a block_matrix.
Also, the only difference between matrix and block matrix is how they print. There are no extra rows/columns.
Either way, if you just want A,b,c then just delete the lptab stuff. Finally, just put in your code at the bottom
and then pressing Two should run it. If you aren't finished then let me know and I'll put in some cvxopt stuff for Monday

@interact(layout=[['inst1'],['inst2'],['varss'],['variables', 'con', 'ob'],['a']])
def _(inst1 = text_control("To run program, first type in constraint equations and objective function, press checkbox and One to get an initial Tableau", label = ""),
      inst2 = text_control("Then press Two to get your answer.", label = ""),
      a = selector(['Reset','One','Two'], default = 'Reset', buttons = True, label = "Steps", width = 6),
      varss = text_control("If you want to use different variables type: var(\'variables\') Then press Reset", label = ""),
      variables = input_box(default = var('x,y,z'),label = 'Variables',width=4),
      con = input_grid(3,1, label = "Constraints", width=30),
      ob = input_box(label = "Objective Function", width=20)):
    if a == 'Reset':
        con = []
        ob = None
    elif a == 'One':
        A = [[] for i in range(len(con))]
        b = matrix([i.right() for i in con])
        c = [ob.coeff(i) for i in variables]
        c = matrix(c)
        for i in range(len(con)):
            A[i] = [con[i].left().coeff(j) for j in variables]
        A = matrix(A)
        lptab = block_matrix([[A.augment(identity_matrix(len(con))),b.transpose()],[c.augment(zero_matrix(QQ,1,3)),0]])
        print 'A: \n' + str(A)
        print 'b: ' + str(b)
        print 'c: ' + str(c)
        print lptab
    elif a == 'Two':
        #you guys put in your code here, and delete None
        None
